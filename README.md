# Rock Paper Scissor Application 

## Introduction: 

This is just a small project that I started back in December 2017. I was in a period where I was
learning to develope Android Application. 
I soon started working on this little project after learning the basics of Android development.
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissor game, with a easy user interface that is fairly easy to use 
by anyone. 

## How does it work? 

The user-interface of the Application is very easy to use. You are playing against 
the computer where the computer choses Rock, Paper or Scissors at random. 
While the player will have the option of choosing their hand. 
The game ends after one of the players have reached 3 wins. You will also have the option
of playing multiple rounds against the Computer!
