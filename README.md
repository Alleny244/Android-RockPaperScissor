# Rock Paper Scissor Application 

## Introduction: 

This is just a small project that I started back in December 2017. I was in a period where I was
learning to develope Android Application. The whole Application is written in Java. 
I soon started working on this little project after learning the basics of Android development.
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissor game, with a easy user interface that is fairly easy to use 
by anyone. 

## How does it work? 

The game is pretty simple and straight forward. You are playing against 
the computer where the computer choses Rock, Paper or Scissors at random. 
While this is happening the user has also the same option. The result will then be presented
and either one of the players will get a point for each time they win. 
The game ends after one of the players have reached 3 wins/points. You will also have the option
of playing multiple rounds against the Computer!
